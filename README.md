Time travel with `timecop` for your Rails app (in development, staging or other env).

Very often you need to create objects or other things in the "past". With thins gem and excellent `timecop` gem you can freeze time to any date/time.

For developers & QA's.

## Usage

Open `/rails/time_travel` to see

/>](https://github.com/igorkasyanchuk/rails_time_travel/blob/main/docs/time_travel.png?raw=true)

Now you can adjust the datetime. Once you are done - just reset time (you will see a red button).

Note, that this datetime change is related only to your session.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'rails_time_travel' # you can also use it on staging env or production
end
```

## Limitations

- this approach has all limitation which timecop has. In addition it won't work on your background jobs or SQL's with `NOW()`, because this gem doesn't change system time and background job is a separate process.
- selected datetime is static, it means that value is freezed, if you need to change it you need to reset or adjust it with buttons

## Contributing

* `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6_1.gemfile bundle exec rake test` to run for Rails 6.1
* `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_6_0.gemfile bundle exec rake test` to run for Rails 6.0
* `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_5_2.gemfile bundle exec rake test` to run for Rails 5.2

## TODO

- jump to a specific datetime with datetime picker?
- CI for Rails 4.X
- protect with password (for example how I did in rails_performance gem)
- go the the future?
- make datetime not static? (use lambda)
